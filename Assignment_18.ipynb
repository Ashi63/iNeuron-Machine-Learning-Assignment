    "Supervised and unsupervised learning are two major types of machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning involves the use of labeled data to train a model to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. The labeled data has both input features and the corresponding output (or target) variable. The model learns the relationship between the input features and the output variable and can make predictions on new, unseen data based on this relationship. Some examples of supervised learning algorithms are linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, unsupervised learning involves finding patterns or structure in data without any labeled target variable. Unsupervised learning algorithms are used when we do not have any specific target variable or when we want to explore the data to find insights or hidden patterns. Some examples of unsupervised learning algorithms are clustering, anomaly detection, principal component analysis (PCA), and association rule mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, consider the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Predicting Housing Prices\n",
    "Suppose we want to predict the selling price of houses based on their features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. In this case, we have labeled data where the input features are the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc., and the output variable is the selling price. We can use supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression or decision trees to train a model on this data and make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

    "Suppose we want to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. In this case, we have a dataset with customer purchase history, but we do not have any specific target variable. We can use unsupervised learning algorithms such as clustering or PCA to find patterns in the data and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.\n",

    "1. Hierarchical Clustering: In this method, the clusters are created recursively by merging smaller clusters into larger ones. The result is a tree-like structure called a dendrogram that shows the relationships between the clusters. The two types of hierarchical clustering are agglomerative and divisive. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as its own cluster and recursively merges the closest clusters. Divisive clustering, on the other hand, starts with all data points in a single cluster and recursively splits them into smaller clusters.\n",

    "2. Partitioning Clustering: In this method, the data points are partitioned into a fixed number of clusters. The most popular partitioning method is k-means clustering, which involves randomly initializing k cluster centroids and iteratively updating them until convergence. The goal is to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and its closest centroid.\n",

The algorithm then calculates the mean of all the data points assigned to each centroid and updates the centroid location accordingly. This process is repeated iteratively until convergence, where the centroids no longer move significantly.\n",

A low WCSS value indicates that the clustering is consistent and well-defined.\n",
