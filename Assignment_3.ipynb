The expert provides guidance and feedback, helping the learner to acquire new knowledge and skills. This type of learning is common in formal education settings such as schools and universities, but it can also occur in informal settings such as apprenticeships and internships.\n",

This type of learning is becoming increasingly popular in the digital age, as people have access to a wealth of information online.\n",

    "- 3. Regression and classification\n",
    "    - Regression is used to predict a continuous numerical value or quantity, such as a price, temperature, or length. The goal of regression is to find a function that best fits the relationship between the input features and the target variable. Regression algorithms include linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, and support vector regression, among others.\n",
    "    - Classification, on the other hand, is used to predict a categorical value or class label, such as whether an email is spam or not, or whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The goal of classification is to find a function that separates the input features into distinct categories. Classification algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, among others.\n",
