Another approach is to use ensemble methods, such as incremental PCA or incremental clustering, which can build the model incrementally by adding new components or clusters as new data arrives. This allows the model to adapt to changing data patterns over time and can be especially useful in domains such as fraud detection, anomaly detection, or recommendation systems, where new data is constantly being generated."

Anomalies are often defined as data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data points in the dataset.

Anomaly detection is used in various applications, such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, and fault detection.\n",

Novelty detection is often used in applications where the data is expected to change over time, and the model needs to adapt to the new data. One of the most common techniques used in novelty detection is the one-class SVM, which is trained to identify data points that are similar to the training data and can detect novel data points that do not fit into the trained model.\n",
