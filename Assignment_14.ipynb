The goal is to learn a general mapping function from input to output that can be applied to new unseen data.\n",

It calculates the difference between the entropy of the target variable before and after splitting on a particular attribute. The attribute with the highest knowledge gain is chosen as the splitting attribute at each node of the decision tree."

    "\n",
    "1. Interpretability: Decision trees are very intuitive and easy to interpret, making them an ideal choice when the goal is to gain insights into the data. Decision trees allow users to see the most important variables and the relationships between them, making it easy to identify patterns and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-parametric: Decision trees do not require any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data or the relationship between the variables. This means that they can be used to analyze any type of data, regardless of its distribution or complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Robustness: Decision trees are relatively robust to noise and outliers, and can handle missing values without requiring imputation. This makes them a good choice for data sets with missing data or noisy data."

    "Overfitting: Decision trees can sometimes overfit the training data, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. This is because the tree may become too complex, capturing noise and irrelevant features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to small changes: Decision trees can be sensitive to small changes in the training data, which can lead to different trees being generated. This can make the model less stable and harder to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulty handling continuous variables: Decision trees are better suited for categorical variables, and can struggle with continuous variables. This can result in the tree treating continuous variables as categorical, which can lead to a loss of information and decreased accuracy."

    "Random Forest is an ensemble learning model based on decision trees. It uses a combination of multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. In a random forest, multiple decision trees are built on different subsets of the training data, and each tree is trained independently using a different subset of the features. The final prediction is then made by taking the majority vote of all the individual tree predictions.\n",

    "Random Forests are known for their high accuracy, ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality, and their resistance to overfitting. They can be used for both classification and regression tasks, and are particularly useful when dealing with noisy data or data with missing values. Additionally, Random Forests can also provide feature importance rankings, allowing for better understanding of which features are most important in predicting the outcome."
